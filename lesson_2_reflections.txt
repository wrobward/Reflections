What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize the repository git creates a hidden file that will allow it to track the metadata and store the commits of the repository. You need to do it to allow you to utilize it as version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is the areas files are placed before commiting them to the working directory. It allows you to do a commit per file instead of each file in the repository.
